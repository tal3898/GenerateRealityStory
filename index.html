"I am married to my best friend. I realized that it is hard being in a relationship, so my friend and I decided to get married. The society does not get it, and thinks it is wrong. I get a lot of shaming comments on instagram or facebook. They need to understand that this is who we are, and this is an important message I want to give here.",
"I lost my fingernail in the army. My friends and I were in the army. And in one of the battles, a grenade was thrown at me and I jumped on my friend to save him, and it cost me with my fingernail, the most used organ in my body. It was hard for me to get over this, but after a while, I had to accept the fact, that I lost my fingernail."
